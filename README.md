# react-tutorial-using-brunch-react-redux

A re-implementation of React tutorial with Brunch.io and react-redux.

It uses Brunch.io as a scaffolding tool together with the react-redux skeleton.

React-Redux is used to move the state handling out of React and into Redux instead.
Redux is used as a state container and for state handling via reducers.

To start:
- get the code
- npm install
- npm start

The application will be accessible on http://localhost:3000
